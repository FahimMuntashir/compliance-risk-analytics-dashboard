## 🚀 Project Overview
Organizations that operate across international supply chains must ensure compliance with ethical and legal standards. This project demonstrates how **compliance audit data** can be transformed into actionable insights using modern data tools.

The dataset (2023 Q4 – 2025 Q2) was processed, cleaned, and visualized to highlight:
- The most common compliance issues across multiple countries.
- Severity distribution of violations (Critical, Major, Minor, Serious).
- Trends in violation rates over time.
- Country-level compliance performance and risk indicators.

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring, benchmarking, and improving compliance practices globally.
